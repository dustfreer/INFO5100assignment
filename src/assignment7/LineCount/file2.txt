The Maria fire erupted on Thursday near the community of Santa Paula, about 70 miles (110 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and it has since charred 9,400 acres (3,800 hectares) of dry brush and chaparral, officials said.

Firefighters have scrambled to protect tens of millions of dollars worth of citrus and avocado crops in harmâ€™s way, as well as oil industry infrastructure.
